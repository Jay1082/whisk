# Progress

## What Works
-   Initial Memory Bank files have been created.
-   Next.js project initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
-   Project file structure cleaned up and dependencies installed.
-   Root layout (`layout.tsx`) configured with Google Fonts (`Noto Sans`, `Plus Jakarta Sans`) and metadata.
-   Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.ts`) updated to use the custom fonts.
-   Main page (`page.tsx`) structure recreated from the initial HTML.
-   Global styles (`globals.css`) set up.
-   Images for paint components organized into `public/components/exterior/` and `public/components/interior/`.
-   Main page (`page.tsx`) updated to dynamically display paint component images and names using Next.js `Image` component.
-   Image display respects original aspect ratios (requires user to input actual image dimensions).
-   Implemented image selection feature allowing multiple selections, with a blue drop-shadow outline, scale effect (transition 300ms), and a numbered badge indicating selection order.
-   Resolved Next.js build error by adding "use client" directive to `page.tsx`.
-   Fixed clipping of the blue hue (drop-shadow) by removing `overflow-hidden` from the image wrapper div.
-   Implemented Interior/Exterior view toggle with separate component lists, maintaining page layout and selection features.
-   Increased the size of the component images in the grid by adjusting Tailwind grid column definition.
-   Added a smooth fade transition (300ms) for the component grid when switching between Interior/Exterior views.
-   Created a new page `src/app/configure/wrought-iron-railings/page.tsx` for configuring Wrought Iron Railings.
-   Implemented navigation from the main page to the Wrought Iron Railings configuration page if it's the only selected item.
-   Added clickable button options for parameters on the Wrought Iron Railings configuration page, with state management for selections.
-   Adjusted the image on the Wrought Iron Railings configuration page to be smaller and have no border/background, blending with the page.
-   Significantly redesigned the Wrought Iron Railings configuration page (`src/app/configure/wrought-iron-railings/page.tsx`) for improved visual appeal and user experience, incorporating: 
    - Light gray background and two-column layout (image left, questions right).
    - Larger image with shadow.
    - Questions styled as individual cards.
    - Enhanced styling for choice buttons.
    - Improved text inputs for Length/Height with stacked labels, units, and state management.
    - Updated typography for titles and links.
    - Added a primary "Add to Estimate" button with a placeholder action.
- Removed the image from the Wrought Iron Railings configuration page to evaluate the layout of the questions section alone; the questions section now takes full width.
- Significantly redesigned the Wrought Iron Railings configuration page (`src/app/configure/wrought-iron-railings/page.tsx`) for improved visual appeal and user experience, incorporating various UI enhancements.
- Implemented a global state management for the estimate using React Context (`EstimateContext.tsx`):
    - `EstimateProvider` wraps the application in `layout.tsx`.
    - `useEstimate` hook provides access to `configuredItems` and actions.
    - `EstimateSidebar.tsx` now consumes this context to display items and handle remove/edit (edit is placeholder) actions.
    - `src/app/page.tsx` (EstimatorPage) no longer manages this state locally.
- The Wrought Iron Railings configuration page (`src/app/configure/wrought-iron-railings/page.tsx`) now uses `addItemToEstimate` from the context to add configured railings to the global estimate. It includes basic validation and then navigates back to the main page.
- The main page header (title, links, button) was removed from `src/app/page.tsx`.
- Resolved a linter error in `EstimateSidebar.tsx` related to duplicate `EstimateItem` interface definitions.
- The `EstimateSidebar` is now part of the root layout (`layout.tsx`), making it persistent across all pages.
- `src/app/page.tsx` and `src/app/configure/wrought-iron-railings/page.tsx` have been updated to remove their own full-page layout structure, relying on `layout.tsx`.
- Horizontal padding on the main component selection area in `src/app/page.tsx` was reduced.
- Spacing on the component selection page (`src/app/page.tsx`) was further reduced:
    - Side padding of the content area changed from `px-10 md:px-20` to `px-4 md:px-8`.
    - Gap between component items in the grid changed from `gap-3` to `gap-2`.
    - Internal spacing for individual component items also reduced.
- Spacing on the component selection page (`src/app/page.tsx`) was minimized:
    - Gap between component items in the grid changed from `gap-2` to `gap-1`.
    - Internal spacing (gap and padding-bottom) for individual component items changed from `gap-2 pb-2` to `gap-1 pb-1`.
- Deck Configuration (`src/app/configure/deck/page.tsx`):
    - Added `width` property to `DeckSubComponentConfig` for `deck-posts` and `deck-trellis`.
    - Implemented UI for configuring `width` (posts) / `length` (trellis) and `height` for these components.
    - Updated area calculation logic:
        - `deck-posts`: `width * height * quantity`. `calculatedQuantity` is set from user input. **Update**: `parseFloatOrDefault` now uses a default of `0` for `width`, `height`, and `userQuantity`. `calculatedQuantity` is explicitly set to `undefined` as area is the primary displayed value.
        - `deck-trellis`: `userLength * height`.
    - "Configure Details" button now available for posts and trellis.
    - Updated `deck-posts` details UI to a 3-column layout (Width, Height, Columns/Quantity).
    - Changed primary dimension display for `deck-posts` to show total Area (SqFt) in the card header. The input field in the card header now directly corresponds to `userSqFt` (Area).
    - The "Quantity" input field within the `deck-posts` details section is now editable (bound to `config.userQuantity`). Placeholder is "e.g., 4".
    - Default `userQuantity` for new components/instances is initialized to an empty string (`''`) instead of `'0'`.
    - Corrected `useEffect` logic to ensure `userQuantity` for `deck-posts` remains `''` by default if unedited, instead of being forced to `"0"` by the calculation.
    - Removed direct SqFt display from the detail views for both `deck-posts` and `deck-trellis`.
    - Adjusted conditional styling for the main parameters section to correctly apply top margin/border when `deck-posts` or `deck-trellis` details are visible.
    - Added quick name-change buttons (e.g., Columns/Supports for posts, Trellis/Verticals for trellis) in their respective detail configuration UIs.

## What's Left to Build
1. User to update `paintOptions` (both `exteriorPaintOptions` and `interiorPaintOptions`) in `page.tsx` with actual `imgWidth` and `imgHeight` for *all* images.
2. Implement full edit functionality for items in the sidebar.
3. Generalize the configuration page system (and context interaction) for other components beyond Wrought Iron Railings.
4. Thoroughly test responsiveness and visual fidelity for all pages and views.
5. Consider adding a visual cue for the active toggle button beyond just background color (e.g., font weight).
6. Add tests.
7. Final review and cleanup.

## Current Status
-   Core page structure and content rendering with local images is complete.
-   Ready for visual review and further feature implementation if any.

## Known Issues
-   None at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
-   **Decision (Initial)**: Use TypeScript for the project.
-   **Decision (Updated)**: Migrated paint component images from external URLs/placeholders to local images served from `public/components/` and used Next.js `Image` component for rendering.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Modified image rendering to use `width` and `height` props on the `Image` component and `style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}` to maintain original aspect ratios, fitting container width. User input for actual dimensions is pending.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Implemented image selection using React state. Selected images get a blue `drop-shadow` outline and scale effect. Marked `page.tsx` as Client Component.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Removed `overflow-hidden` from image item wrapper to prevent `drop-shadow` clipping.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Implemented Interior/Exterior views using React state and organized image assets.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Increased image display size by modifying the `minmax` value in the Tailwind CSS grid column definition from `158px` to `192px`.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Increased image display size via Tailwind grid column definition.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Implemented a fade-in/fade-out transition for the component grid (initially 300ms, then updated to 500ms) when switching views, using `useState` for visibility and `setTimeout` to sequence state changes with CSS opacity transitions.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Reverted overall grid fade transition to 300ms. Individual image selection transition (scale/drop-shadow) is 300ms.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Modified selection state to use an array `string[]` to allow multiple selections and preserve order. Selected items display a numbered badge indicating their selection sequence.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Selection state uses an array `string[]` for multiple, ordered selections with badges.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Created a dedicated route and page (`/configure/wrought-iron-railings`) for component-specific configuration. Navigation to this page is enabled via `useRouter` from the main page when only "Wrought Iron Railings" is selected.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Created a dedicated route and page for Wrought Iron Railings configuration. Navigation enabled from main page.
-   **Decision (Active)**: On the Wrought Iron Railings config page, parameters for decorativeness, rust, and plants are now selectable via button groups, with selections managed by local React state.
-   **Decision (Initial)**: Keep external image URLs for now, noting that local hosting/CDN is better for production.
-   **Decision (Active)**: The image on the Wrought Iron Railings configuration page was made smaller and its container styling removed for a transparent background effect.
-   **Decision (Active)**: The Wrought Iron Railings configuration page (`src/app/configure/wrought-iron-railings/page.tsx`) underwent a major redesign based on detailed UI/UX feedback. This included a two-column layout (subsequently, the image column was removed for layout evaluation), card-based question sections, improved button and input styles, a clearer call to action, and controlled components for all inputs. The question section now temporarily takes full width.
-   **Decision (Active)**: State for configured estimate items is now managed globally using React Context (`EstimateContext`).
-   **Decision (Active)**: The Wrought Iron Railings configuration page adds its configured item to this global context and redirects to the main page.
-   **Decision (Active)**: The `EstimateSidebar` displays items from this global context.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Image was removed from Wrought Iron Railings config page for layout testing.
-   **Decision (Active)**: The `EstimateSidebar` is now part of the root layout, making it persistent. Individual pages render their content within the main area defined by the layout.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Margins on the component selection page have been reduced.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Spacing (both side margins and inter-component gaps) on the main component selection page (`src/app/page.tsx`) has been reduced for a more compact look.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Spacing between component items on the main selection page (`src/app/page.tsx`) has been minimized (grid `gap-1`, item internal `gap-1 pb-1`) for maximum compactness.
-   **Decision (Active)**: Deck Configuration (`src/app/configure/deck/page.tsx`):
        - Added `width` property to `DeckSubComponentConfig` for `deck-posts` and `deck-trellis`.
        - Implemented UI for configuring `width` (posts) / `length` (trellis) and `height` for these components.

            - `deck-trellis`: `userLength * height`.
        - "Configure Details" button now available for posts and trellis.
        - Updated `deck-posts` details UI to a 3-column layout (Width, Height, Columns/Quantity).

        - Default `userQuantity` for new components/instances is initialized to an empty string (`''`) instead of `'0'`.
        - Corrected `useEffect` logic to ensure `userQuantity` for `deck-posts` remains `''` by default if unedited, instead of being forced to `"0"` by the calculation.
