# Product Context

## Problem Solved
The user has an existing HTML design and wants to migrate it to a more robust and scalable framework, specifically Next.js with React and Tailwind CSS. This allows for better componentization, server-side rendering capabilities, optimized performance, and easier maintenance and future development.

## How it Should Work
The application should be a single-page application (initially) that replicates the layout and styling of the provided HTML.
- Navigation links should be present.
- Image elements should be displayed correctly.
- Text content and styling should match the original.
- The page should be responsive as implied by Tailwind CSS usage and the original design.

## User Experience Goals
- **Visual Fidelity**: The recreated page should closely match the visual appearance of the original HTML.
- **Performance**: The Next.js application should load quickly and provide a smooth user experience.
- **Maintainability**: The codebase should be well-structured, making it easy to understand and modify.
